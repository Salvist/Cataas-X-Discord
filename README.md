# Cataas-X-Discord
Synchronous two APIs with Cataas and Discord.

This is written purely in Node.js and no third library at all. This application will request a random cat image/gif from Cataas and then get the client user discord information. The workflow is syncrhonous and the discord authentication is OAuth 3LO.

If you want to try it out, you will need a discord account and create an application over there. Discord will give you client id and client secret and save it as credentials.json in auth folder.
